# GNOME Wallpaper Setter Script
This is a Bash script that allows user to choose a wallpaper and set it from a predefined directory.

## Before use
This script checks a fixed directory which is **/home/_user_/Pictures/Wallpapers**, which means you have to have one.
If you don't have, create one and move your wallpaper archive over there.

You can change this directory before running the script:
	`search_dir = _your desired directory_`

## Make it runnable on CLI
After downloading, copy it to one of your _$PATH_. To do so:
```
sudo cp chbckg.sh /usr/local/bin/chbckg
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/chbckg
```

### RUN!
Now you can just type **chbck** on CLI and the script will list all the images on the defined directory.

## Usage
- Type **0 (zero)** to exit. 
- Type the image number that you want to make the wallpaper.
